#### Reconnaissance:
Commence the assessment by conducting reconnaissance to gather valuable information about the target machine.  

Use the Nmap tool to perform a comprehensive scan of the target machine with the following command: ```nmap -sC -sV <target ip>```

Interpret the scan results to identify open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities.
